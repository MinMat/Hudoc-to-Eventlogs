    "CaseName": "CASE OF V.M. AND OTHERS v. BELGIUM",
    "CaseText": "E\n  1.\u00a0\u00a0The case originated in an application (no. 60125/11) against the Kingdom of Belgium lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by seven Serbian nationals, Mr V.M., Mrs S.G.M. and their five children S.M., E.M., S.M., E.M. and E.M.M. (\u201cthe applicants\u201d), on 27\u00a0September 2011. The President of the Section to which the case had been assigned acceded to the applicants\u2019 request not to have their names disclosed (Rule 47 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of Court).\n  2.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants were represented by Ms E. N\u00e9raudau, a member of the Nantes Bar. The Belgian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr M. Tysebaert, and by their co-Agent, Ms\u00a0I.\u00a0Niedlispacher, of the Federal Justice Department.\n  3.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants alleged that they had been subjected to living conditions in Belgium that had been incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention and had caused their eldest daughter\u2019s death. They also submitted that the removal order against them had exposed them to a situation which had put their lives and physical integrity at risk. They complained, further, that they had not had an effective remedy in that regard.\n  4.\u00a0\u00a0The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule\u00a052 \u00a7\u00a01). In a judgment of 7 July 2015 a Chamber of that Section composed of the following judges: I??l Karaka?, President, Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3, Neboj\u0161a Vu?ini?, Helen Keller, Paul Lemmens, Egidijus K?ris and Jon\u00a0Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro, judges, and also of Abel Campos, Deputy Section Registrar, declared the application admissible and concluded that there had been a violation of Article 3 on account of the applicants\u2019 reception conditions (five votes to two); no violation of Article 2 regarding the first and second applicants\u2019 daughter\u2019s death (unanimous); and a violation of Article\u00a013 taken in conjunction with Articles 2 and 3 regarding the effectiveness of the appeal against the removal order (four votes to three). The dissenting opinions of Judges Saj\u00f3, Keller and Kj\u00f8lbro were annexed to the Chamber judgment.\n  5.\u00a0\u00a0On 7 October 2015 the Government requested the referral of the case to the Grand Chamber in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention. On 14\u00a0December 2015 the panel of the Grand Chamber granted that request.\n  6.\u00a0\u00a0The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Convention and Rule 24.\n  7.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants and the Government each filed further written observations (Rule 59 \u00a7 1).\n  8.\u00a0\u00a0Observations were also received from the French Government, from Myria, the Federal Migration Centre, and from the non-governmental organisations Coordination et initiatives pour r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et \u00e9trangers (Cir\u00e9), D\u00e9fense des enfants international (DEI) and Groupe d\u2019information et de soutien des immigr\u00e9s (GISTI), which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule\u00a044 \u00a7 3).\n  9.\u00a0\u00a0The Serbian Government, who had been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 36 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Rule\u00a044\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4), gave no indication that they wished to do so.\n  10.\u00a0\u00a0A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 May 2016 (Rule 59 \u00a7 3).\n  \n  There appeared before the Court:\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0for the respondent Government\nMrs\tI. NIEDLISPACHER, \tco-Agent,\nMr\tN. JACOBS, Deputy director, Federal Agency for the Reception of \n\tAsylum-seekers (Fedasil),\t\nMr\tD. KOOTZ, Senior lawyer, Fedasil,\tAdvisers;\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0for the applicants\nMrs\tE. N\u00c9RAUDAU, lawyer,\tCounsel,\nMr \tL. LEB\u0152UF, lawyer, EDEM-UCL researcher,\nMr\tY. PASCOUAU, director of the European Policy Centre,\nMrs \tA. PERROT,\tAdvisers.\n  \n  The Court heard addresses by Mrs N\u00e9raudau and Mrs Niedlispacher and their replies to the questions put by the judges.\nTHE FACTS\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n  11.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants were born in 1981, 1977, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2011 respectively. The eldest daughter of the first and second applicants, S.M., died after the application had been lodged, on 18 December 2011.\n  12.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants have spent the greater part of their lives in Serbia. They left Serbia in 2010 for Kosovo and in February 2010 they went to France, where they lodged applications for asylum. The second applicant\u2019s application was registered by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (\u201cthe OFPRA\u201d) on 10\u00a0May 2010 and the first applicant\u2019s on 18 May 2010. On 4 June 2010 their applications were rejected on the grounds that they had not responded to the summons to appear before the OFPRA on 31 May 2010 and that their written statements, which were too vague, did not enable the OFPRA to grant their application.\n  13.\u00a0\u00a0According to the information provided by the applicants, they stayed in France for about two months, apparently in Mulhouse. They alleged that they had only been provided with night-time accommodation and had been obliged to leave the hostel in the mornings, taking their physically and mentally disabled daughter, S.M., in a pushchair. They submitted that they had left France before the OFPRA issued its decision and returned to Kosovo, and subsequently to Serbia, in May 2010.\n  14.\u00a0\u00a0In March 2011 they went to Belgium, where they lodged an asylum application on 1 April 2011. On the same day the Federal Agency for the reception of asylum seekers (Fedasil) assigned them a place in a reception facility, the Morlanwez asylum-seekers\u2019 reception centre.\n  15.\u00a0\u00a0On 4 April 2011 the applicants had an interview with the \u201cDublin\u201d department of the Aliens Office during which they gave an account of their journey and their reasons for seeking asylum.\n  16.\u00a0\u00a0On 12 April 2011 the Belgian authorities sent France a request to take the applicants back under Council Regulation (EC) No.\u00a0343/2003 of 18\u00a0February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (\u201cthe Dublin\u00a0II Regulation\u201d).\n  17.\u00a0\u00a0Initially, France refused to take charge of the applicants on the grounds that they had probably left the territory of the Member States for more than three months, which was a ground for refusing to take them back under Article 16(3) of the Dublin II Regulation. After the Belgian authorities had reiterated their request, on 6 May 2011 the French authorities agreed to take the family back. They indicated that the transfer should be effected under escort to the border control post of Rekkem and asked to be given three days\u2019 notice of the transfer.\n  18.\u00a0\u00a0On 17 May 2011 the Aliens Office issued a decision refusing the applicants leave to remain and ordering them to leave the country for France within seven days (decision known as an \u201cannex 26quater\u201d, which is the name of the corresponding form) on the grounds that Belgium was not responsible for examining the asylum application under Article 16(1)(e) of the Dublin II Regulation and that France had agreed to take the applicants back. The decision indicated that as the applicants had not expressed fears regarding the French authorities or adduced evidence of any traumatic experience in France and France was a country which respected human rights, was a signatory to many conventions and had independent courts to which the applicants could apply, Belgium did not have to take responsibility for the asylum application under Article 3(2) of the Dublin\u00a0II Regulation. The applicants were issued with laissez-passer to enter France.\n  19.\u00a0\u00a0On 26 May 2011 execution of the order to leave the country was extended until 25\u00a0September 2011 on grounds of the second applicant\u2019s pregnancy.\n  20.\u00a0\u00a0In May 2011 the applicants contacted a lawyer with a view to challenging the Dublin transfer decision. On 16 June 2011 they lodged an application with the Aliens Appeals Board through their lawyer seeking judicial review of the decision and an ordinary request for an order staying execution. They relied on a number of grounds, in particular the failure to mention any statutory basis for their transfer to France and their fears regarding the poor reception conditions they had experienced during their first stay in France and a possible transfer to Serbia, and adduced evidence that they had left the territory of the European Union for more than three months.\n  21.\u00a0\u00a0After the second applicant had given birth at the end of July, on 5\u00a0August 2011 the family was assigned a place in a new reception centre, in Saint-Trond, 66 km from Brussels.\n  22.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants appeared at the hearing on 26 August 2011 before the Aliens Appeals Board to examine their request for judicial review of the order to leave the country.\n  23.\u00a0\u00a0On 22 September 2011, relying on the state of health of their daughter S.M., they sought leave to remain on medical grounds under section 9ter of the Aliens Act. Their application was declared inadmissible by the Aliens Office on 30 September 2011 on the grounds that the medical certificate produced in support of their application certified the existence of a medical condition and the treatment considered necessary but, contrary to the statutory requirements, did not specify the degree of seriousness of the young S.M\u2019s illness. The applicants did not learn of that decision until much later, during the proceedings before the Court.\n  24.\u00a0\u00a0On the expiry of the time-limit granted in the order to leave the country the applicants were excluded from the Saint-Trond reception facility, which they left on 27\u00a0September 2011. They travelled to Brussels by train and went to Place Gaucheret, where other Roma families were staying. They spent a number of days there.\n  25.\u00a0\u00a0On 29 September 2011 the applicants\u2019 lawyer applied to the French\u001espeaking community\u2019s General Delegate to the Rights of the Child seeking his assistance in finding accommodation for the family. On 5\u00a0October, after the General Delegate had contacted various institutions, the applicants were given a place in the Woluwe-Saint-Pierre transit centre in Brussels.\n  26.\u00a0\u00a0On 7 October 2011 Fedasil assigned them a reception centre in Bovigny 160 km from Brussels. The applicants were provided with train and bus tickets and directions to the reception centre.\n  27.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants submitted before the Court that they had gone to the Bovigny centre but had been refused entry on the grounds that their documents (their \u201cannexes\u201d) were not valid. The Government stated, for their part, that the applicants had been expected at the Bovigny centre but had failed to turn up. In the proceedings before the Grand Chamber the Government produced exchanges of correspondence between Fedasil and the employees at the centre indicating that a room with a baby\u2019s cot had been prepared for the applicants, that a shuttle service from the station to the centre had been organised and that their place had been kept for them for several days before being reassigned.\n  28.\u00a0\u00a0The family then went to the Gare du Nord in Brussels where they stayed for over two weeks before accepting a voluntary return programme and returning to Serbia on 25 October 2011.\n  29.\u00a0\u00a0The first and second applicants\u2019 eldest daughter died there of a pulmonary infection on 18\u00a0December 2011.\n  30.\u00a0\u00a0In a judgment of 29 November 2011 the Aliens Appeals Board set aside the order to leave the country (see paragraph 18 above) on the grounds that the decision had not properly established the legal basis on which France had been designated as the responsible State. With regard to the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 referred to by the applicants, the Aliens Appeals Board considered that such a risk had not been made out. It observed that the applicants had not drawn the administrative authority\u2019s attention to any particular difficulties regarding the reception arrangements organised by the French authorities, particularly concerning access to medical care for their children, and that they had not submitted any evidence corroborating their allegations regarding the conditions of their accommodation. With regard to the general situation concerning reception arrangements in France, the Aliens Appeals Board observed that the applicants had not referred to circumstances of which the respondent had or ought to have had knowledge, the evidence submitted before it having been considered vague and incomplete.\n  31.\u00a0\u00a0The Belgian State lodged an appeal on points of law with the Conseil\u00a0d\u2019\u00c9tat. The appeal was initially declared admissible, but ultimately declared inadmissible on 28\u00a0February 2013 on grounds of the State\u2019s lack of interest in appealing given that the applicants had left Belgian territory more than three months ago and Belgium was no longer responsible for determining the State responsible under the Dublin II Regulation.",
