    "CaseName": "CASE OF KORNEYKOVA AND KORNEYKOV v. UKRAINE",
    "CaseText": "E\n  1.\u00a0\u00a0The case originated in an application (no. 56660/12) against Ukraine lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by two Ukrainian nationals, Ms Viktoriya Yuryevna Korneykova (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d) and her son Mr Denis Yuryevich Korneykov (\u201cthe second applicant\u201d), on 31 August 2012.\n  2.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants were represented by Ms Y. Zaikina and Mr\u00a0G.\u00a0 Tokarev, lawyers practising in Kharkiv. The Ukrainian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, most recently Mr\u00a0B.\u00a0Babin, of the Ministry of Justice.\n  3.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant alleged that she had been shackled to her bed during her stay in a maternity hospital. She also complained about her placement in a metal cage during court hearings. Lastly, she complained on behalf of herself and the second applicant that the material conditions of their detention and the medical care provided to the second applicant in the Kharkiv Pre-Trial Detention Centre (\u201cthe Kharkiv SIZO\u201d) had been inadequate.\n  4.\u00a0\u00a0On 12 October 2012 the President of the Fifth Section decided to apply Rule\u00a039 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government that the applicants should be kept in conditions suitable for a small child and a nursing mother. It was specified, in particular, that adequate medical supervision and care should be provided to the second applicant for the duration of the proceedings before the Court.\n  5.\u00a0\u00a0On the same date the application was given priority under Rule 41 of the Rules of the Court and it was communicated to the Government.\n  6.\u00a0\u00a0On 22\u00a0February 2013 the application of Rules 39 and 41 of the Rules of Court was discontinued at the Government\u2019s request as by that time the first applicant had been released (see paragraph 75 below).\nTHE FACTS\nI.\u00a0\u00a0THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n  7.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants are a mother and child born in 1990 and 2012 respectively.\nA.\u00a0\u00a0Background facts\n  8.\u00a0\u00a0On 16 January 2012 the first applicant, who was in the fifth month of pregnancy, was detained by the police on suspicion of robbery.\n  9.\u00a0\u00a0On 26 January 2012 the Dzerzhynskyy District Court of Kharkiv (\u201cthe Dzerzhynskyy Court\u201d) ordered her pre-trial detention as a preventive measure pending trial.\n  10.\u00a0\u00a0On the same date she was placed in the Kharkiv SIZO.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0Conditions of the first applicant\u2019s stay in the maternity hospital\n  11.\u00a0\u00a0On 22 May 2012 the first applicant was taken to Kharkiv Maternity Hospital no. 7 (\u201cthe maternity hospital\u201d).\n  12.\u00a0\u00a0On the same date she gave birth to the second applicant. He measured 49 cm and weighed 2.9 kg.\n  13.\u00a0\u00a0Three female security officers guarded the first applicant in the hospital. According to her, they stayed on the ward at all times. The Government submitted that they had left the ward during the delivery.\n  14.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant alleged she had been continuously shackled to her hospital bed or to a gynaecological examination chair, the only exception being during the delivery when the shackles had been removed. It is not clear from her submissions exactly how she had been shackled; on one occasion, she submitted that after the delivery she had had her foot shackled to the bed. At the same time, she submitted that the guards had only removed the shackles from her wrists for breastfeeding.\n  15.\u00a0\u00a0According to the Government, the first applicant was never handcuffed or shackled in the maternity hospital.\n  16.\u00a0\u00a0On 25 May 2012 the applicants were discharged.\n  17.\u00a0\u00a0On 12 November 2012 the first applicant wrote in a statement for the SIZO administration (see paragraphs 41 and 76) that the maternity hospital staff had treated her well, that she had not been handcuffed or shackled, and that the two female security officers who had been on her ward had been helping her take care of the baby.\n  18.\u00a0\u00a0In December 2012 and January 2013 the prosecution authorities questioned some maternity hospital staff and the security officers who had guarded the first applicant with a view to verifying her allegations, particularly as regards her shackling (see also paragraphs 76-82 below).\n  19.\u00a0\u00a0On 21 December 2012 the chief doctor of the maternity hospital wrote to the governor of the Kharkiv SIZO, in reply to an enquiry by the latter, to say that during her stay in the maternity hospital the first applicant had been guarded by SIZO officers at all times, that the officers in question had not been on the delivery ward, and that the first applicant had not been handcuffed or shackled during the delivery.\n  20.\u00a0\u00a0On 24 December 2012 the chief obstetrician, Ms Ti., gave a written statement to the prosecution authorities. She submitted that the first applicant had been shackled by the wrists to the gynaecological examination chair during her examinations both in the admissions unit and later in the obstetric unit, and that it was usual practice for detainees to be shackled and guarded by three guards.\n  21.\u00a0\u00a0Two other obstetricians, Ms F. and Ms\u00a0S., and a nurse, Ms\u00a0To., made similar statements. Ms F. submitted that she could not remember any details regarding the second applicant\u2019s delivery. Ms\u00a0To. specified that the first applicant had not been shackled during the delivery or subsequently during breastfeeding.\n  22.\u00a0\u00a0The chief doctor of the neonatal unit Ms\u00a0Vl. also submitted that the first applicant had been shackled to a gynaecological examination chair. Furthermore, she indicated that two guards had been staying on the ward near the applicants, with a third near the door.\n  23.\u00a0\u00a0The security officers who had guarded the first applicant denied that she had been handcuffed or shackled in hospital.\n  24.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant\u2019s lawyer enquired with a former nurse, Ms P., about the conditions faced by women in detention during delivery, with reference to her related work experience. On 7 February 2013 Ms\u00a0P. wrote to him indicating that she had indeed worked as a nurse at Donetsk Regional Childcare and Maternal Health Centre from 1996 to 2005, and that in 2004 or 2005 a detained woman had been shackled to her bed during her baby\u2019s delivery there.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0Conditions of detention in the Kharkiv SIZO\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Physical conditions of detention\n  25.\u00a0\u00a0While the first applicant was held in several different cells in the SIZO, her application form referred only to the conditions of her detention with her baby in cell no. 408, in which she had been held from 14 March to 8\u00a0November 2012. The summary of facts below therefore only concerns that cell.\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant\u2019s account\n  26.\u00a0\u00a0The cell, situated in a semi-basement, was cold and damp. There was no hot water and only an irregular supply of cold water. The first applicant therefore rarely had the opportunity to take a shower and bath her new-born son. She also had to store cold water in plastic bottles for her own use. She boiled water on a defective electric cooker in a kettle, which she had to borrow from the administration and which was provided to her for no longer than fifteen minutes each time. The toilet and shower were in a niche not separated from the living area. The toilet was often blocked. There was no baby changing table or cot in the cell.\n  27.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant was not provided with any baby hygiene products. Nor did she receive nutrition suitable to her needs. On the days of court hearings her only meal was breakfast, which consisted of bread and tea. No packed lunches were provided to her.\n  28.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants were able to have outdoor walks of about ten minutes per day, but not every day, in a communal walking area.\n  29.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, one of the inmates she shared with was HIV positive.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0The Government\u2019s account\n  30.\u00a0\u00a0Cell no. 408 was a high-comfort cell designed for pregnant women and women with children. It was located on the ground floor, measured fifty-two square metres and could accommodate up to six people. The first applicant shared it with two or sometimes three inmates.\n  31.\u00a0\u00a0The cell had three windows measuring over eight square metres in total. There was hot and cold water, as well as a drinking water cooler with a capacity of ten litres.\n  32.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, there were all the necessary furniture and facilities such as air conditioning, a refrigerator, an electric stove, a baby cot and a pram. There was also a supply of nappies and hygiene products. The toilet and shower were separated from the living area.\n  33.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant was provided with adequate nutrition in accordance with the applicable standards (the total energy value of her daily meals being 3,284 kilocalories). She received three hot meals per day with the exception of hearing days, when she missed lunch. She breastfed her son and refused the baby food provided by the SIZO. There were no restrictions on food or other parcels she received from her relatives.\n  34.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants had a daily two-hour walk in a specially designated area.\n  35.\u00a0\u00a0They never shared a cell with inmates with HIV.\n  36.\u00a0\u00a0The Government provided four colour photographs of cell no.\u00a0408, showing a spacious and light room in a visually good state of repair. There were three large windows with sheer curtains. The cell had a washbasin. There was also a lavatory with a bidet and a shower cubicle, both separated from the living area by opaque glass doors. Also on the photographs were a wardrobe, two beds with bedside cabinets, a cot, a table with two stools, a baby stool, a shelf with some tableware, a microwave, a television and a baby changing table.\n  37.\u00a0\u00a0Another photograph showed a walking area for detained mothers with babies, with a flowerbed and a wall with a nature mural. The first applicant and her baby were on the photograph, as well as another woman with a pram.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0Other detainees\u2019 accounts and relevant information\n  38.\u00a0\u00a0On 1 and 2 February 2012 the local sanitary and epidemiological service inspected the SIZO in the context of an unspecified investigation. It observed that there was a special cell for women with babies, with all the essential amenities. It was noted in the report that there had been no pregnant inmates or inmates with babies in the SIZO at the time of the inspection.\n  39.\u00a0\u00a0On 24 May 2012 the sanitary and epidemiological service also inspected the drinking water in the SIZO to check that it complied with the relevant standards. No\u00a0irregularities were found.\n  40.\u00a0\u00a0On 22 October 2012 the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office informed the Agent of the Government that there had been no complaints from the first applicant regarding the conditions of detention or the second applicant\u2019s medical care in the SIZO.\n  41.\u00a0\u00a0On 12 November 2012 the first applicant wrote a statement giving a detailed description of her cell in the SIZO similar to that submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 30-37 above). The last paragraph also concerned her stay in the maternity hospital (see paragraph\u00a017 above).\n  42.\u00a0\u00a0On 13 November 2012 one of the SIZO staff wrote to the State Prisons Service to say that the first applicant\u2019s statement had been made freely.\n  43.\u00a0\u00a0During her detention in the Kharkiv SIZO the first applicant received about thirty food parcels from her mother, often with basic foodstuffs such as bread, butter, tea, sugar and milk.\n  44.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant lodged numerous requests for release with the trial court dealing with her criminal case, subject to an undertaking not to abscond (dated 6 July, 6, 26 and 31 August, 3\u00a0September and 9\u00a0October 2012). She alleged, in particular, that the conditions in the SIZO were not adequate for her baby. The court rejected those requests.\n  45.\u00a0\u00a0The applicants\u2019 case received some media coverage. For example, in November 2012 the article \u201cBaby as a victim of inhuman treatment\u201d was published online by the Kharkiv Human Rights Group. In December 2012 a television programme was broadcast, in which the first applicant and the State authorities gave accounts, particularly as regards the conditions of the applicants\u2019 detention in the SIZO. The parties did not submit to the Court a copy of the relevant article or video footage or a transcript of the television programme.\n  46.\u00a0\u00a0On 12 December 2012 one of the detainees, Ms B., wrote a statement addressed to the head of the local department of the State Prisons Service. She submitted that in November 2012 she had been held in the same cell as the first applicant and had been satisfied with the conditions of detention there. It was noted in the statement that there had been large windows in the cell, a shower cubicle with hot and cold water and all the necessary furniture and appliances, including a refrigerator and a television.\n  47.\u00a0\u00a0On 19 December 2012 the Kharkiv Regional Department of the State Prisons Service issued a memorandum stating that the first applicant had not submitted any complaints during her detention in the Kharkiv SIZO.\n  48.\u00a0\u00a0The case file contains three statements by detainee Ms\u00a0M. concerning the conditions of detention in the SIZO. She wrote two of them while detained there (on an unspecified date and on 25\u00a0December 2012), and a third on 30 January 2013 when she had already begun serving her prison sentence elsewhere. In the first two statements Ms M. described the conditions of her detention in cell no. 408 as quite satisfactory and comfortable. Her account was similar to that given by the Government (see paragraphs 30-32 above). The first two statements also contained critical remarks regarding the first applicant claiming, in particular, that she had displayed a careless attitude towards her baby and had acted in bad faith in applying to the Court. In her third statement, Ms M. stated that the food in the SIZO had been poor. More specifically, the bread had been stale and the meat had been tinged blue. She also submitted that there had been no hot water in cell no.\u00a0408. Lastly, she submitted that on two occasions she had witnessed the first applicant requesting medical care for her baby when he had had stomachache, but her requests had been ignored.\n  49.\u00a0\u00a0On 28 December 2012 a former detainee, Ms Sa., wrote a statement for the first applicant\u2019s lawyer and had it certified by a notary. She stated that she had shared cell no.\u00a0408 with the first applicant from an unspecified date in March to 19\u00a0April 2012. Ms Sa. had been pregnant at the time. She described the conditions of their detention as follows. The cell was located in a semi-basement and inmates saw practically no daylight. The windows were so high that they could not be opened without the assistance of a guard. There were about seven inmates in the cell, some of them with HIV and some suffering from other illnesses. The toilet was separated from the living area by a waist-high wall and leaked. As a result, there was always a bad smell. The shower also leaked and the cubicle door was broken. It was so humid in the cell that the plaster had fallen off the ceiling and the walls were covered in mould. The cell was infested with mice and lice. There were no household appliances like a kettle or microwave. Nor were there any beds or bedside cabinets as shown by the State Prisons Service on television (see paragraph 45 above). Ms Sa. specified that in fact none of the detainees had ever been held in the cell presented by the authorities on television. There was no hot water and the pressure in the cold water taps was so low that inmates had to store water for their own use. Furthermore, the SIZO administration did not provide them with any tableware. Their daily walk lasted only twenty minutes and took place in a small walking area covered with bars. Furthermore, according to Ms Sa., the food in the SIZO was neither fresh nor tasty. Lastly, she stated that she had been shackled to her bed when undergoing some treatment in the maternity hospital in Kharkiv while pregnant.\n  50.\u00a0\u00a0On an unspecified date Ms Ve., who had also shared cell no.\u00a0408 with the first applicant (the exact period is unknown), wrote a statement about the conditions of detention there. Her description was similar to that given by Ms Sa. as regards the leaking toilet, high humidity levels, lack of hot water and irregular supply of cold water, as well as the duration and conditions of the daily outdoor walks and poor nutrition.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Medical care for the second applicant\n  51.\u00a0\u00a0On 25 May 2012 the applicants were discharged from the maternity hospital. The second applicant was found to be in good health.\n  52.\u00a0\u00a0According to a letter from its chief doctor to the first applicant\u2019s lawyer dated 12 December 2012, on 25 May 2012 the second applicant was transferred to Children\u2019s Hospital no. 19 (\u201cthe children\u2019s hospital\u201d). All the other relevant documents in the case file indicate that on 25\u00a0May 2012 both applicants were taken to the Kharkiv SIZO.\n  53.\u00a0\u00a0As submitted by the first applicant and noted in a letter by the chief doctor of the children\u2019s hospital to the first applicant\u2019s lawyer dated 6\u00a0September 2012, a paediatrician from that hospital had examined the second applicant on 28\u00a0May 2012. The baby was found to be in good health but to have phimosis (a condition of the penis where the foreskin cannot be fully retracted).\n  54.\u00a0\u00a0However, according to the second applicant\u2019s medical file kept by the SIZO, the first time a paediatrician of the children\u2019s hospital examined him was on 31\u00a0May 2012. He was found to be in an adaptation period and the first applicant received advice regarding childcare.\n  55.\u00a0\u00a0According to the second applicant\u2019s medical file, on 12\u00a0June 2012 he was examined again by a paediatrician, who diagnosed him with intestinal colic and recommended Espumisan, massage, feeding on demand and outdoor walks. The doctor also suspected that the boy had a patent (open) foramen ovale (PFO; the foramen ovale allows blood circulation in the fetal heart and closes in most individuals at birth).\n  56.\u00a0\u00a0The second applicant\u2019s next medical examination appears to have taken place on 20 July 2012. It was noted in his medical file that the paediatrician had given advice to the first applicant regarding feeding and care.\n  57.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant denied that any of the examinations following that on 28 May 2012 had taken place. She alleged that her baby had not been examined by a paediatrician until 10 September 2012. She submitted that the records of her son\u2019s earlier examinations in the medical file had been forged. According to her, the first page of that book referred to an examination on 10 September 2012, whereas the records of his earlier examinations had been written on separate pages and subsequently glued into the file. The case file as it stands before the Court contains a separate copy of each page of the file, which makes it impossible to verify the first applicant\u2019s allegation.\n  58.\u00a0\u00a0On 28 August 2012 the first applicant\u2019s lawyer asked the Kharkiv SIZO administration to provide him with details of when the second applicant had been examined by a paediatrician and whether the conditions of detention had been appropriate for such a small baby. He also requested copies of the relevant documents.\n  59.\u00a0\u00a0On 4 September 2012 the SIZO administration replied that it would be able to provide comprehensive information on the second applicant\u2019s health after a complete medical examination in the children\u2019s hospital, which was due to take place.\n  60.\u00a0\u00a0On 31 August 2012 the first applicant asked the judge dealing with her case to order a medical examination of her son \u201cgiven that the SIZO administration [was] ignoring her requests to that effect\u201d. It appears that her request was rejected.\n  61.\u00a0\u00a0On 6 September 2012 the chief doctor of the children\u2019s hospital wrote to the first applicant\u2019s lawyer in reply to an enquiry by him dated 5\u00a0September 2012. He said that with no paediatrician at the Kharkiv SIZO, a paediatrician from that hospital monitored babies born there. He also indicated that the second applicant had been examined by the hospital paediatrician on 28 May 2012 (see also paragraph 53 above). In so far as the lawyer enquired about the baby\u2019s medical condition at the material time, the chief doctor stated that it was impossible to provide him with such information because the first applicant had not requested any medical care for him until then.\n  62.\u00a0\u00a0On 10 September 2012 a dermatologist, cardiologist, ear, nose and throat specialist, neurologist and paediatrician all examined the second applicant. He was found to have allergic dermatitis, dysplastic cardiomyopathy and phimosis. Furthermore, the patent foramen ovale diagnosis had been called into question (see paragraph 55 above). The doctors concluded that the second applicant did not require any medical treatment, but recommended that the mother follow a hypoallergenic diet.\n  63.\u00a0\u00a0According to the first applicant, the examination was carried out in the context of custody proceedings initiated by the second applicant\u2019s stepfather. She specified that it had been done with her consent so that the second applicant could be taken from the SIZO, where he was not receiving adequate care.\n  64.\u00a0\u00a0On 14\u00a0September 2012 the SIZO sent a copy of the second applicant\u2019s medical file to the applicants\u2019 representative, further to a request made by him on 28\u00a0August 2012 (see paragraph 58 above).\n  65.\u00a0\u00a0On 18 October 2012 the chief doctor of the children\u2019s hospital wrote to the first applicant\u2019s lawyer, in reply to an enquiry made on 10\u00a0October 2012, to say that hospital was in charge of the medical supervision of children in the Kharkiv SIZO where needed, subject to the SIZO administration making the relevant application. It was also noted that the second applicant required an additional examination in the regional cardiology centre, and that the children\u2019s hospital had already requested the SIZO administration\u2019s cooperation in that regard.\n  66.\u00a0\u00a0On 19 October 2012 a paediatrician and a cardiologist examined the second applicant again. He was diagnosed with a patent foramen ovale (a heart condition, see paragraph 55 above for further details) and an additional examination was recommended.\n  67.\u00a0\u00a0On the same date the second applicant underwent an echocardiogram and was found to be healthy.\n  68.\u00a0\u00a0On 14 November 2012 the first applicant refused to allow her son to undergo a paediatrician examination, which she had been offered.\n  69.\u00a0\u00a0The following day the first applicant was released (see also paragraph\u00a075 below).\n  70.\u00a0\u00a0On 30 November 2012 the first applicant\u2019s lawyer enquired with the children\u2019s hospital whether it had kept a medical file in respect of the second applicant and whether he had been vaccinated during his stay with the first applicant in the SIZO.\n  71.\u00a0\u00a0On 4 December 2012 the chief doctor replied that the children\u2019s hospital provided medical care to children residing permanently in its catchment area. As regards children residing there temporarily, a written application by one of the parents was required. The first applicant had never submitted such an application. Accordingly, the hospital had not opened a medical file in respect of the second applicant. At the same time, its doctors had examined him when requested by the SIZO administration. The results of each examination had been reflected in the medical file provided by the SIZO. In so far as the second applicant\u2019s vaccinations were concerned, it was noted that he had always been brought for examinations without his mother, and without her consent no vaccinations had been given.\nD.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant\u2019s placement in a metal cage during court hearings\n  72.\u00a0\u00a0On 12 April, 17 May, 15 June, 2 and 31 August and 15\u00a0November 2012 the first applicant participated in court hearings, during which she was held in a metal cage. Her requests not to be placed in a cage were rejected.\n  73.\u00a0\u00a0On 14 March 2013 the judge of the Dzerzhynskyy Court, who had been in charge of the first applicant\u2019s case, wrote to the Agent of the Government, in reply to the latter\u2019s request, to say that the first applicant had indeed been held in a metal cage in the courtroom during hearings. The judge emphasised that it was a legal requirement to place criminal defendants in a metal cage and there were no exceptions to this rule. Furthermore, he considered that allowing the first applicant to remain outside the cage in the courtroom would have been equal to her temporary release, contrary to the custodial preventive measure applied.\n  74.\u00a0\u00a0On 15 March 2013 the Ministry of the Interior confirmed once again to the Agent of the Government that the first applicant had been held in a metal cage in the courtroom during hearings. It further specified that the second applicant had remained with the SIZO medical specialist outside the cage and had been passed to her for breastfeeding when requested.\nE.\u00a0\u00a0The first applicant\u2019s complaints after her release and their investigation\n  75.\u00a0\u00a0On 15 November 2012 the first applicant was released on an undertaking not to abscond.\n  76.\u00a0\u00a0On 25 December 2012 she complained to the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office that she had been shackled to her bed in the maternity hospital at all times, including during the delivery. She also complained that the conditions of detention and nutrition in the SIZO had been inadequate. Lastly, the first applicant alleged that the statement she had written on 12\u00a0November 2012 expressing her satisfaction with the conditions of detention had been made under psychological pressure (see paragraphs 17 and 41 above).\n  77.\u00a0\u00a0On 27 December 2012 the State Prisons Service completed the internal investigation it had undertaken following the media coverage of the applicants\u2019 case (see paragraph 45 above). The first applicant\u2019s allegations were dismissed as unsubstantiated.\n  78.\u00a0\u00a0On 2 January 2013 the first applicant complained to the Kharkiv Zhovtnevyy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe Zhovtnevyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d) that she had not been provided with adequate medical care during her pregnancy and the delivery; that she had been shackled by her wrists and feet to a gynaecological examination chair or her bed in the maternity hospital at all times, including during the delivery; that the conditions of her detention in the Kharkiv SIZO had been poor; and that neither she nor her baby had received adequate medical care there. On the same date her complaint was registered in the Integrated Register of Pre-trial Investigations and the investigation was started.\n  79.\u00a0\u00a0On 18 January 2013 the Zhovtnevyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office ordered a forensic medical examination of the case material with a view to establishing: (i)\u00a0whether the first applicant had any injuries and, if so, how they had been caused; (ii) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the first applicant had been handcuffed or shackled between 26\u00a0January and 15\u00a0November 2012; (iii)\u00a0whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the applicants had not been provided with adequate or sufficient medical care in the Kharkiv SIZO; (iv) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the applicants had not been provided with adequate or sufficient medical care in the maternity hospital; and (v) if the applicants had not received adequate or sufficient medical care, whether this had had any negative impact on their health.\n  80.\u00a0\u00a0The aforementioned examination continued from 18\u00a0January to 26\u00a0March 2013. The answers in the report to all five questions were negative.\n  81.\u00a0\u00a0On 1 April 2013 the Zhovtnevyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the criminal investigation for lack of evidence of a criminal offence.\n  82.\u00a0\u00a0Also in April 2013 the State Prisons Service, following an enquiry by the Government\u2019s Agent, undertook an internal investigation as regards the lawfulness of the second applicant\u2019s detention in the SIZO. On 22\u00a0April 2013 it was completed, with the conclusion that there had been no violation. It was noted in the report that, although in August\u00a02012 the first applicant had verbally expressed her intention to transfer the custody of her baby to her mother, she had later changed her mind as she had been breastfeeding.\nII.\u00a0\u00a0RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n  83.\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 9 of the Pre-Trial Detention Act 1993, detained women are entitled to keep with them children up to the age of three. As further specified in this provision, all detainees are entitled to a daily outdoor walk for one hour, whereas the duration of such walks for pregnant women and women with children may be extended up to two hours.\n  84.\u00a0\u00a0The Rules on detention in pre-trial detention centres, approved in 2000, reiterate the above provisions (Rules 2.1.5 and 4.1.3). Under Rule\u00a08.1.2, detainees at an advanced stage of pregnancy (over five months) and those with children should be provided with living space of at least 4.5 square metres. Beds for those categories of detainees should be on one level. Cots should also be provided. The annexes to the Rules require that walking areas for pregnant detainees and those with children should have grass, flowers and a children\u2019s sandpit.\n  85.\u00a0\u00a0The Clinical Protocol for medical care of children up to the age of three, approved by Order no. 149 of the Ministry of Public Health in 2008, provides for integrated standards in this area. Section 2.1 provides that children under three must have medical examinations. More specifically, these should comprise a general health assessment; an assessment of the child\u2019s physical and psychomotor development; an assessment of the child\u2019s nutrition; a timely identification of any illnesses and pathologies; vaccinations; consulting the parents regarding childcare, nutrition, development and accident prevention; and defining the tactics of further medical supervision and care.\n  86.\u00a0\u00a0The Clinical Protocol also establishes the following schedule for the mandatory medical examinations (in so far as is relevant for this case): weekly during the first month of life and monthly thereafter until the child is one year old (section 2.2.9).\n  87.\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 27 of the Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare of the Population Act 1994 (as worded at the material time), vaccinations against tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and measles are obligatory in Ukraine.\n  88.\u00a0\u00a0The vaccination schedule approved by an order of the Ministry of Public Health in 2011 (as worded at the material time) contains a list of vaccinations and the ages they should be given. A newborn child is supposed to receive twelve vaccinations by the age of six months (including booster injections).\nIII.\u00a0\u00a0RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\nA.\u00a0\u00a0United Nations documents\n  89.\u00a0\u00a0The relevant provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979) read as follows:\nArticle 12\n \u201c... States Parties shall ensure to women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, confinement and the post-natal period, granting free services where necessary, as well as adequate nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.\u201d\n  90.\u00a0\u00a0The Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) provides, in so far as relevant:\nPreamble\n \u201c... Bearing in mind that the need to extend particular care to the child has been stated in the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child of 1924 and in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child adopted by the General Assembly on 20\u00a0November 1959 and recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (in particular in articles 23 and 24), in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (in particular in article 10) and in the statutes and relevant instruments of specialized agencies and international organizations concerned with the welfare of children,\n Bearing in mind that, as indicated in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, \u2018the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth\u2019,\n ...\u201d\nArticle 3\n \u201c1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\n 2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being ...\u201d\n  91.\u00a0\u00a0The relevant parts of the Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (2011) read as follows:\n \u201cThe General Assembly,\n ...\n Recalling further its resolution 58/183 of 22 December 2003, in which it invited Governments, relevant international and regional bodies, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to devote increased attention to the issue of women in prison, including the children of women in prison, with a view to identifying the key problems and the ways in which they can be addressed ...\u201d\nRule 33\n \u201c...\n 3. Where children are allowed to stay with their mothers in prison, awareness\u001eraising on child development and basic training on the health care of children shall also be provided to prison staff, in order for them to respond appropriately in times of need and emergencies.\n ...\u201d\nRule 48\n \u201c1. Pregnant or breastfeeding women prisoners shall receive advice on their health and diet under a programme to be drawn up and monitored by a qualified health practitioner. Adequate and timely food, a healthy environment and regular exercise opportunities shall be provided free of charge for pregnant women, babies, children and breastfeeding mothers.\n 2. Women prisoners shall not be discouraged from breastfeeding their children, unless there are specific health reasons to do so.\n 3. The medical and nutritional needs of women prisoners who have recently given birth, but whose babies are not with them in prison, shall be included in treatment programmes.\u201d\nRule 49\n \u201cDecisions to allow children to stay with their mothers in prison shall be based on the best interests of the children. Children in prison with their mothers shall never be treated as prisoners.\u201d\nRule 50\n \u201cWomen prisoners whose children are in prison with them shall be provided with the maximum possible opportunities to spend time with their children.\u201d\nRule 51\n \u201c1. Children living with their mothers in prison shall be provided with ongoing health-care services and their development shall be monitored by specialists, in collaboration with community health services.\n 2. The environment provided for such children\u2019s upbringing shall be as close as possible to that of a child outside prison.\u201d\n  92.\u00a0\u00a0According to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (\u201cthe\u00a0WHO\u201d) which were adopted following its Joint Interregional Conference on Appropriate Technology for Birth (Fortaleza, Brazil, 22-26\u00a0April 1985), the healthy newborn must remain with the mother whenever both their conditions permit it. The WHO recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and newborn 2013 also state that the mother and baby should not be separated and should stay in the same room 24 hours a day.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0Council of Europe documents\n  93.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Punishment or Treatment (CPT) Standards (document no.\u00a0CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 - Rev. 2015, p. 45) contain the following relevant provisions:\nHealth care services in prisons\nExtract from the 3rd General Report [CPT/Inf (93) 12]\n \u201c64. Certain specific categories of particularly vulnerable prisoners can be identified. Prison health care services should pay especial attention to their needs.\n i) mother and child\n 65. It is a generally accepted principle that children should not be born in prison, and the CPT\u2019s experience is that this principle is respected.\n 66. A mother and child should be allowed to stay together for at least a certain period of time. If the mother and child are together in prison, they should be placed in conditions providing them with the equivalent of a creche and the support of staff specialised in post-natal care and nursery nursing. ...\u201d\nVI. Women deprived of their liberty\nExtract from the 10th General Report [CPT/Inf (2000) 13]\nAnte natal and post-natal care\n \u201c26. Every effort should be made to meet the specific dietary needs of pregnant women prisoners, who should be offered a high protein diet, rich in fresh fruit and vegetables.\n 27. It is axiomatic that babies should not be born in prison, and the usual practice in Council of Europe member States seems to be, at an appropriate moment, to transfer pregnant women prisoners to outside hospitals.\n Nevertheless, from time to time, the CPT encounters examples of pregnant women being shackled or otherwise restrained to beds or other items of furniture during gynaecological examinations and/or delivery. Such an approach is completely unacceptable, and could certainly be qualified as inhuman and degrading treatment. Other means of meeting security needs can and should be found.\n 28. Many women in prison are primary carers for children or others, whose welfare may be adversely affected by their imprisonment.\n One particularly problematic issue in this context is whether - and, if so, for how long - it should be possible for babies and young children to remain in prison with their mothers. This is a difficult question to answer given that, on the one hand, prisons clearly do not provide an appropriate environment for babies and young children while, on the other hand, the forcible separation of mothers and infants is highly undesirable.\n 29. In the view of the CPT, the governing principle in all cases must be the welfare of the child. This implies in particular that any ante and post-natal care provided in custody should be equivalent to that available in the outside community. Where babies and young children are held in custodial settings, their treatment should be supervised by specialists in social work and child development. The goal should be to produce a child-centred environment, free from the visible trappings of incarceration, such as uniforms and jangling keys.\n Arrangements should also be made to ensure that the movement and cognitive skills of babies held in prison develop normally. In particular, they should have adequate play and exercise facilities within the prison and, wherever possible, the opportunity to leave the establishment and experience ordinary life outside its walls.\n Facilitating child-minding by family members outside the establishment can also help to ensure that the burden of child-rearing is shared (for example, by the child\u2019s father). Where this is not possible, consideration should be given to providing access to creche-type facilities. Such arrangements can enable women prisoners to participate in work and other activities inside the prison to a greater extent than might otherwise be possible.\u201d\n  94.\u00a0\u00a0The Report to the Ukrainian Government on the visit to Ukraine carried out by the CPT from 29 November to 6 December 2011 (CPT/Inf (2012) 30) reads as follows:\n \u201c43. The delegation gained a generally positive impression of the material conditions in the units for juveniles at the [SIZO] in ... Kharkiv.\n However, conditions of detention were quite simply appalling in many of the other detention units of the [SIZO]. Numerous cells were in a poor state of repair and had only very limited access to natural light. In addition, the CPT is concerned about the severe overcrowding observed in a number of detention units of [the establishment]. At the time of the visit, the [...] Kharkiv SIZO [was accommodating] 3,415 prisoners (official capacity: 2,808 places).\u201d",
